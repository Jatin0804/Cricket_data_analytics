Mohammad Rizwan†,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.

Paul van Meekeren,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.

Dinesh Karthik†,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Not many would forget the sight of Dinesh Karthik in India colours, horizontal on the ground, as he stumped Michael Vaughan in 2004. It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. ",,,

Barry McCarthy,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Barry McCarthy is an Ireland seam bowler whose involvement with Durham owed much to a recommendation by their England allrounder, Ben Stokes, who faced him in the nets before a one-day international and advised his county to take a look. Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger.

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt.",,,

Sean Williams,Zimbabwe,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Middle order Batter,"Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering.",,,

He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures.

Michael Leask,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

He started 2014 as part of the Afghanistan Under-19 team that defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in the Under-19 World Cup, and ended it as a member of the squad for Afghanistan's first full World Cup campaign.

Jason Holder,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"Jason Holder was seen as a future talent until a selection panel headed by former World Cup-winner Clive Lloyd appointed him West Indies' ODI captain in 2014. Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young.

George Munsey,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"Known as the reverse-sweeping demon of the Associate world, George Munsey's path to the Scotland national team is as unorthodox as his trademark shot.

Naseem Shah,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited may not be an esteemed name in Pakistan cricket, but it was for this deparment that Naseem Shah made his first-class debut at 15.

Kusal Mendis†,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. ",,,
